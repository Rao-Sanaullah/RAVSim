RAVSim stands for Run-time Analysis and Visualization Simulator. It is solely designed with the aim of helping early-stage researchers and students to fully understand the mechanism of SNNs where users can interact with the simulator in run-time by providing the essential parameters. Practically, RAVSim is used to simulate LIF by using a noisy input model.
RAVSim is developed on a graphical programming language platform called LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench)
